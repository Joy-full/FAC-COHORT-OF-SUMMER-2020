        <p>" Hey, I am <span>Joeun Lee</span>.</p>
        <p>My friends call me Joy. That’s why here is Joy-full World. Positive, Challenging and Curious, these three words can describe myself the best.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small city called Gwangju, South Korea. I’ve always wanted to explore this amazing world. Last year, I’ve moved to London, the most exciting city in the world. I enjoyed London as a professional tour guide for a year. 
        <p>Since this year, I have had a lot of free time so I began to learn coding by YouTube channels. <span>With coding, I have felt very fun to build anything in my head.</span> At some point, I was determined that coding would be absolutely my area. I can’t wait to shape the future with learning coding through Founder and Coders.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting me and hope that you are interested in my webpage. Enjoy :) "</p>

        <div class="WhyMePartsSub">#Good Team Player</div>
        <p>When I was IT volunteer in Malaysia, my team had a lot of projects including giving daily class and creating mobile application. My team members were exhausted to meet tight deadlines in unfamiliar surroundings.</p> 
        <p> However, <span>I often encouraged other members and picked up the slack for others so that my team members won’t give up on our tasks.</span> At the end, we overcame it together. This made me a great supporter for a team. I look forward to share my positive power and motivation at Founders and Coders.
      </div>
    
      <div class="WhyMePartsPara">
        <div class="WhyMePartsSub">#Contribution</div>
        <p>Most importantly, I like not only to learn new things but also to share my knowledge. <span>It’s really rewarding that people around me develop with my advice, and that process helps me a lot to growing up myself as well.</span> That’s why I was a mentor for foreign students in my university and taught IT and English as a volunteer.</p>
        <p>I can’t even imagine what Founders and Coders has provided. But I’d undoubtedly give back what I’ve got to community. It’s growth!</p>

      <div class="WhyMePartsPara">
        <div class="WhyMePartsSub">#Curiosity</div>
        <p>I’m always not afraid to challenge new things in facing new situation. Sales assistant, festival coordinator, video producer, IT teacher and recently tour guide. This diverse experience has enriched my life and developed many skills. I haven’t found life-long job where I am given the opportunity to learn and challenge constantly though.</p> 
        <p>But Coding would be the one I’ve tried to find. <span>I got to know that I’ve been excited to solving problems and building new things while studying myself.</span> From now, I look forward to being surrounded by curious people at Founders and Coders.</p>

          <h3>#Peer-led Leaning</h3>
          <p>Every time I have challenged new things, I first started to work on myself. I’ve leveled up.However, I’ve come to understand that something more is needed to reach even higher levels of improvement. That is other people with a common goal of improving. There would be virtually endless possibilities to what can be achieved.</p> 
          <p>I strongly believe that peer-led leaning is the most effective route into the tech industry.Also, I am impressive that graduates contribute back to the development of the program. They would understand well what learners want and need.</p>
          <p>Synergy would be coming up!</p>

          <h3>#Principle of reciprocity</h3>
          <p>When I think of self-improvement, I think of how I could improve so that everyone around me gets to improve as well. For the sake of reciprocity, I hope to inspire the people around me to do the same well. This way, new highs of improvement can be reached. Each person should seek to improve themselves. And at the same time, they should seek to improve the relationship, so that the relationship itself can bear even more fruits.</p>
          <p>Two heads are better than one!</p>
