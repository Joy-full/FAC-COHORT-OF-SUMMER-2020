        <p>Hey, I am Joeun. My friends call me Joy. That’s why here is Joy-full World. Positive, Challenging and Curious, these three words can describe myself the best.<br>
        I was born and raised in a small city called Gwangju, South Korea. I’ve always wanted to explore this amazing world. Last year, I’ve moved to London, the most exciting city in the world. I enjoyed London as a professional tour guide for a year. Since this year, I have had a lot of free time so I began to learn coding by YouTube channels. With coding, I have felt very fun to create something out of nothing and build anything in my head. At some point, I was determined that coding would be absolutely my area. I can’t wait to shape the future I want with learning coding through Founder and Coders.<br>
        Thank you for visiting me and hope that you are interested in my webpage. Have fun :)</p>
